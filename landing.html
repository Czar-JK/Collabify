		Collabify is an online web application that helps businesses increase productivity by providing them with an environment to organize their projects, tasks, and employees. Managers will be able to post jobs and add users to them. Job owners can assign tasks, distinguish ongoing workloads, and add duties to a kanban style board that will feature unstarted, ongoing, and finished categories, as well as progress meters. We will also display this info in a new, visually appealing way utilizing the javascript library D3 to create SVGs. 

		&nbsp; Collabify wonâ€™t just redefine the kanban board visually. It will be an innovative platform that integrates a social network style presentation, effectively allowing users to connect and communicate with others. This is especially important for those seeking to use our platform to display professional accolades and other non-work related achievements. Specifically, users will be able to display jobs and accomplishments completed in the past on their profiles and share them with friends, coworkers, and employers. Regarding current jobs, however, users will have the ability to confidently work on projects without fear of someone stealing your work. They will be able to set privacy settings for each and every job, allowing certain jobs to stay seperate and some jobs to be hidden all together. It will feature google login integration to document each individuals work and job participation.
